General
========

For each of your team's implementations, explain the following (where appropriate and applicable):

- details on calling conventions, input and output data formats, limitations, bugs, and special features.
- negative aspects of your program (limitations, known bugs)
- positive aspects (extensions, special features)
- describe your choice of modularization (abstractions), data structures, and algorithms
- explain anything you did that is likely to be different from what other students may have done
- justify any design decisions for which the rationale isn't immediately clear

Feel free to modify the structure of this `readme.html` file to fit the current assignment and to fit how you wish to present your findings.


!!! note: Math Typesetting
    Surround your math with double dollar signs to have [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) typeset it beautifully.
    To add a tilde in math mode (using dollar signs), use the `\sim` command.
    If an exponent has more than one character, you must surround it with curly braces.
    In the example below, the exponent for $T$ must use curly braces, but they aren't required for $N$.

    $$ \sim T^{1.2} N^2 $$

    Note: Typesetting like this is optional; feel free to use plain text if you'd like.


Submission
-----------

Use the CSE LogHistory Plug-in to create a zip file containing all your code, this `readme.html` document, and any additional files of evidence (ex: screenshots).
If you create a zip by other means, it will include all the files under `tests` and might miss some important files (ex: `.log/history.log`).
The former will make for a very large zip file; the latter will cause you to lose points.

Implementations
===================


`Neo_Up` Implementation
--------------------------

<!--
Explain briefly how you implemented the search algorithm for the `Neo_Up.java` class.
How did you check that your implementation was correct?
Include code listings, screenshots, diagrams, etc. if helpful.
-->
Courtney and I went for the binary search approach to find "the one". We implemented it as normal, however we came
across a bug in our while loop. We used "&&" statements to check if neo.get(i) did NOT meet all of the conditions we
needed to find the first 1. It never met the qualifications since we used "AND" statements, but Dr. Denning suggested
we use OR statements instead, which made it work great!

We checked that it was correct by testing it and making sure we received a low number of get calls.

`Neo_Down` Implementation
--------------------------

<!--
Explain briefly how you implemented the search algorithm for the `Neo_Down.java` class.

-->

For this one we also used the binary search, using Integer.MAX_VALUE as our upper bound. However, we ran into a bug
when finding the midpoint. We added low to high and then divided both by two. Dr. Denning explained how even though that
made sense mathematically, the computer was halving the lower bound and upper bound before adding the two, which
resulted in weird negative numbers. So we changed it to "low+((high-low)/2)" to clearly tell the computer what we want.

We checked that it was correct by testing it and making sure we received a low number of get calls.

`Neo_Left` Implementation
--------------------------

<!--

`Neo_Right` Implementation
---------------------------

<!--

-->


Known bugs / limitations
-------------------------

<!--
What bugs or limitations were troublesome?
What bugs or limitations still remain?
Are these bugs or limitations a problem in your implementation, algorithm, or something else?
How do you know that you did not miss a bug?
What additional tests did you run to ensure that your implementations are correct?
-->

Bugs with each implementation are explained in their write-ups.

We checked for additional bugs by running each implementation with different seed numbers.


Reflection
===========

<!--
Describe whatever help (if any) that you received.
Don't include readings, lectures, but do include any help from people (including course staff, lab TAs, classmates, and friends) and attribute them by name.
How did you discuss the problem with others? (ex: white-board algorithms, looking over code for bugs, looking at print out results, etc.)
-->

All of our help was received from Dr. Denning. Courtney and I discussed our problem by explaining the algorithm
out loud and then implementing it/changing it through trial and error. We also looked at print out results to see what
the computer was seeing at each step of the process.



<!--
Since this is an individual assignment, if you worked with a partner, assert below that the work you are turning in is your own work, and that you only did "whiteboard" work as a group.
Give one sentence explaining what each of you contributed.
If you used the code from the lab challenge, explain what is shared between you and your lab partner.
-->

<!-- ... -->



<!--
Describe any serious problems you encountered.
How much time did you spend writing new code, debugging code, thinking about the algorithms, discussing with someone else, running tests, writing comments and documentation, etc.?
List any other comments here.
Feel free to provide any feedback on how much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed doing it.
-->

We already explained our previous bugs. We did take a stab at the Neo_Left implementation but the double aspect of it
got us caught in an infinite loop.

Overall this was a fun, challenging lab that helped us understand binary search more. If we had more time we would
definitely reduce our get calls by assigning the neo.get(i) to a variable to not call it more than needed.
